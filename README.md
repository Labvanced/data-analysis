# What can I this for?
All the data found in this repository was recorded from online studies on [Labvanced](https://www.labvanced.com/).
You can clone the repository and execute this locally or you can just look at our sample results to infer for instance the accuracy of our eye tracking technology.  

# Sample studies with eye tracking
On in open access library thre are over 250 study templates. Most of then can easily adapted to have eye tracking on top. However, we also privide some
explicit example studies for our eye trakcing technology:

[Target Distractor task ](https://www.labvanced.com/page/library/2909)
[Infant friendly eye tracking ](https://www.labvanced.com/page/library/11657)
[Free viewing ](https://www.labvanced.com/page/library/11062)
[Gaze feedback test](https://www.labvanced.com/page/library/11099)
[Eyetrakcing in a gaming context](https://www.labvanced.com/page/library/11327)
[Sptial Accuracy test](https://www.labvanced.com/page/library/11327)
This study was used in the 'EyeTRackerAccuracy' subfolder to deterine the accuracy of our technology.
