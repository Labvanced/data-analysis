The given data sets and analysis provide a data-driven conclusion about how accurate the Labvanced eye tracking technology is.
To direclty see this online click on the [iPythonNotebook/ipynb file](https://github.com/Labvanced/data-analysis/blob/master/EyeTrackerAccuracy/eyetracking_accuracy.ipynb)

## Where do the provided data sets come from?
All the data sets were recorded from our [spatial accuracy test study ](https://www.labvanced.com/page/library/12990)

## How many subjects were analzed?
The current data set includes data from 10 participants, more will follow.

## Was there any special/additional hardware or software involved when the data sets were recorded?
No, all data was recorded on different but normal laptops, and standard rgb webcams over the internet.

## How can I test the accuracy on my own / verify this?
- Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/Labvanced/data-analysis.git)
- Install the dependencies (pip3 install -r requirements.txt) 
- Import the [spatial accuracy test study ](https://www.labvanced.com/page/library/12990) into your Labvacned account.
- Activate data recording and record data sets locally, or publish the study and acquire data sets online.
- Select the data sets in the data-view and download both "trial data" and "timeseries data".
- Make sure to rename the trial data  to "data.csv" and the timeseries data to "timeseries.csv", and replace those files in the repository
- Run the Jupyter notebook and see the results.
